> *Your very first own Library!*
</br>
</br>
<p> The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.
</br>
<p> It is forbidden to use global variables. If subfuctions are needed, they must be "static". The library must be compiled with ar command (libtool is forbidden).
</br>
<p> C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects. Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
